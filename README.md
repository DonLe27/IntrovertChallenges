IntrovertChallenges
This project is a web application built with Django. 

Motivation
I am an introverted person. In highschool, my equally withdrawn friend and I came up with the idea of Introvert Challenges.
These challenges could be anything from "Go to that woman right there and compliment her hat" to "Strike up a conversation
with someone in line at Chipotle." These spontaneous challenges helped me push my social comfort zones and become less socially
concious. I hope this web application will help others do the same.


Features
Registers and stores user information, including email
Sends users a randomly selected Introvert Challenge from a file every hour
